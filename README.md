# color-recognition
This is a personal project in which I've been working on for a couple of months.
This is a small proyect I have assigned to myself, this program is designed for colorblind people (nevertheless anyone can use it), how it works is quite simple, 
from an specific region of the camera image, the code will identify the colors on it, then will determinate the color of the object in front of the camera and the color will be 
displayed on the screen.

Please leave your opinion.
